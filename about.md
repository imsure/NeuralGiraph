We are a team of professors and students at
[University of St. Thomas](http://www.stthomas.edu/), working together
to apply big data technologies on
[computational neuroscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience)
to simulate brain functionality. We are using MapRudce and [Giraph](http://giraph.apache.org/)
based on Hadoop.

The team includes:

Professors: Jadin C. Jackson,
