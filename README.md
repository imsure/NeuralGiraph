# Large-scale neural network modeling using Giraph on Hadoop

We use Giraph to model large-scale neural network on the Hadoop cluster deployed
at the University of St. Thomas by Department of Graduate Programs in Software.

## Neural network generation with MapReduce

## Run Giraph job for modeling

## Post analysis
