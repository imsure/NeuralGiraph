## Large-scale neural network modeling using Giraph

We use [Giraph](giraph.apache.org) to model large-scale neural network on the [Hadoop](hadoop.apache.org) cluster deployed
at the University of St. Thomas by [Department of Graduate Programs in Software](http://www.stthomas.edu/gradsoftware/).

### Neural network generation with MapReduce

### Run Giraph job for modeling

### Post analysis
