## Simple Model of Spiking Neurons

We are using a
[simple model of spiking neurons](http://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.htm)
presented by [Izhikevich](http://www.izhikevich.org/). The model was
used to simulate tens of thousands of spiking cortical neurons in real
time.

### How model works

We extend the model to support:

 - more types of neurons except cortical neurons
 - multiple channels in the neural network
 - large-scale neural network simulation (hundreds of thoudsands of neurons)

### Simulation results
